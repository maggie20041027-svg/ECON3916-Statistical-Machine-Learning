# Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project applies the Big Mac Index—a widely recognized measure of purchasing power parity—to empirically test the Law of One Price across international markets and assess currency valuation relative to the US Dollar.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze global currency valuations using "Burgernomics" and identify deviations from theoretical purchasing power parity through comparative price analysis of a standardized commodity.

## 🔧 Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Constructed a structured dataset from The Economist's 2015 Big Mac Index, capturing local currency prices and official exchange rates across multiple countries
- **PPP Calculation**: Computed implied purchasing power parity exchange rates by comparing the cost of an identical good (the Big Mac) across different economies
- **Valuation Analysis**: Quantified currency over- or undervaluation by measuring the percentage deviation between implied PPP rates and actual market exchange rates
- **Technical Stack**: Leveraged Python and Pandas for data manipulation, exchange rate calculations, and comparative analysis

## 📈 Key Findings
[This analysis revealed significant currency misalignments against the US Dollar. For example, the Norwegian Krone exhibited overvaluation of X%, suggesting that Big Macs in Norway are substantially more expensive than PPP theory would predict. Conversely, currencies showing undervaluation may present theoretical arbitrage opportunities, though real-world frictions limit exploitation of these disparities. These findings illustrate persistent deviations from the Law of One Price due to factors including trade barriers, transportation costs, and non-tradable input components in final goods pricing.]

## 💡 Economic Context
The Big Mac Index serves as an accessible proxy for purchasing power parity theory, which posits that exchange rates should adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries. Persistent deviations from PPP—as measured here—reflect market inefficiencies, structural economic differences, and the influence of non-tradable services in final product costs.
