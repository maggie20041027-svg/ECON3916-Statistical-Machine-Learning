# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Economic Data Science Portfolio**, a curated collection of coursework and applied labs from **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. This repository is built to showcase how I connect **economic reasoning** with **modern, Python-based data science** workflows.

## About Me

I am an undergraduate **Economics student** pursuing opportunities in **Finance** and **Economics-related** fields. My goal is to demonstrate that I can bridge the gap between **traditional economic theory** and **practical machine learning**—turning models into insights that inform real decisions.

## About this Portfolio

This repository hosts my ECON 3916 coursework and labs, built around a **Concept Extension** philosophy: we begin with foundational statistical concepts (e.g., **regression**) and extend them to scalable machine learning methods (e.g., **Lasso** and other regularization techniques).

Through these projects, I am learning to combine:

- **Causal inference** (economic theory + econometrics mindset)
- **Predictive analytics** (machine learning + out-of-sample performance)

The result is a toolkit that supports both **interpretability** (why something happens) and **prediction** (what is likely to happen next).
